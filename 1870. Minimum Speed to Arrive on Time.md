You are given a floating-point number `hour`, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take `n` trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array `dist` of length `n`, where `dist[i]` describes the distance (in kilometers) of the `i<sup>th</sup>` train ride.

Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train ride.

*   For example, if the `1<sup>st</sup>` train ride takes `1.5` hours, you must wait for an additional `0.5` hours before you can depart on the `2<sup>nd</sup>` train ride at the 2 hour mark.

Return _the **minimum positive integer** speed **(in kilometers per hour)** that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or_ `-1` _if it is impossible to be on time_.

Tests are generated such that the answer will not exceed `10<sup>7</sup>` and `hour` will have **at most two digits after the decimal point**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: At speed 1:
- The first train ride takes 1/1 = 1 hour.
- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 1 hour mark. The second train takes 3/1 = 3 hours.
- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 4 hour mark. The third train takes 2/1 = 2 hours.
- You will arrive at exactly the 6 hour mark.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 2.7
Output: 3
Explanation: At speed 3:
- The first train ride takes 1/3 = 0.33333 hours.
- Since we are not at an integer hour, we wait until the 1 hour mark to depart. The second train ride takes 3/3 = 1 hour.
- Since we are already at an integer hour, we depart immediately at the 2 hour mark. The third train takes 2/3 = 0.66667 hours.
- You will arrive at the 2.66667 hour mark.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 1.9
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible because the earliest the third train can depart is at the 2 hour mark.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == dist.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `1 <= dist[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `1 <= hour <= 10<sup>9</sup>`
*   There will be at most two digits after the decimal point in `hour`.


#### Solution

Language: **C++**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minSpeedOnTime(vector<int>& dist, double hour) {
        int low=1,high=1e7,n=dist.size(),res=-1;
        while(low<=high)
        {
            int mid=(low+high)/2;
            double sum=0;
            for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
            {
                sum+=ceil(dist[i]*1.0/mid);
            }
            sum+=dist[n-1]*1.0/mid;
            //speed is slow need more speed 
            if(sum>hour)
            {
                low=mid+1;
            }
            //good speed  can check for more efficient 
            else
            {
                res=mid;
                high=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
